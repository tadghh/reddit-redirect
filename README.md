# Reddit De-TikTokification Script
Reddit has been TikTokified (the desktop website looks as though it was designed for a phone). This script aims to solve that by redirecting you to the older "new" Reddit.

## What's a userscript?
Userscripts allow you to make changes to websites; this is usually handled with JavaScript. Some scripts focus on feature enhancement, such as adding more settings to YouTube or Bandcamp, or simple things like quality of life (QOL) improvements. Some precautions should be taken, as malicious developers could steal your information or do other sneaky things, like replacing all Amazon links with affiliate ones. Have a developer you trust look over the script before installing it.

# Installation Guide

## 1. Installing a userscript manager
This will be used to run the script included in this repo.

- Google Chrome/Chromium browsers (Brave, OperaGX) - [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- For Firefox - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

## 2. Installing the script
Now we'll install the script from the Greasyfork [website](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/479542-reddit-de-tiktokified).

Your userscript manager (e.g., Tampermonkey) will open when you click the install button on Greasyfork. You will be given a preview of the code and presented with a final install button after this, you should be good to go!
